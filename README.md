# Python Essential Concepts

## Python Objects

- [Iterables, Generators, and yield](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do): iterables are stored in memory, while generators are iterables you can only iterate over once because they generate values. yield is like return but will return a generator. Handy for when you are generating a large list of numbers, you know you will only be using once.

## Decorators

## Typing

## Loops

## Strings

## Exception Handling

- [Try, Except, Else, Finally](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-try-except-else-finally/): try to run a chunk of code and deal with any exceptions appropriately. Else is what will run next if no error is caught. Finally is ran whether an error is caught or not.
